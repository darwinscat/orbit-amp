/** The cabinet as a convolution: one IR, chosen from the shelf, at the end of the chain.

    The family's own convolver does the heavy lifting: felitronics-core's CabConvolver, the one
    OrbitCab plays — true sample-zero latency, a result that does not depend on the host's block
    size, and a new IR built on the message thread into the idle slot and crossfaded in over 50 ms
    on the audio thread, without a click. It replaced `juce::dsp::Convolution`, which loaded on a
    thread of its own at a pace nobody could see and did not agree across platforms about what a
    bad sample does to it (see `process`).

    WHAT A PLAYER DOES TO THE IR is baked into the IR, not run on the audio: a second-order
    high-pass and low-pass over the impulse itself, a trim of its tail, a flip of its sign — the
    raw shot is kept here and rebuilt whenever one of them moves, then handed to the convolver as
    a new IR. The convolution costs exactly what it cost before, whatever is switched on.

    Level: the family reference-unity contract (felitronics::measurement::referenceUnityGain),
    the same one OrbitCab ships — the IR passes the guitar-band reference at unity RMS, so a cab
    contributes TONE, not gain, and swapping cabinets compares voicings at matched loudness. Taken
    after the post, so a cut IR is as loud as the whole one was. JUCE's Normalise::yes is NOT
    usable here: it scales the IR to 0.125 total energy (−18 dB full-band), which lands a
    band-limited guitar signal ~12 dB low and drifts with the session rate. Never load a cab IR
    raw either — 61k taps sum to enormous gain; the reference gain is clamped ±30 dB.

    THREADS. `prepare`, `load`, `setPost` and `flushPending` are the producer's side and take one
    lock: the convolver allows one producer beside the audio thread, and a host may prepare from a
    thread of its own while the message thread's pump is loading. `process` and `idle` are the
    audio thread's and take none. */
