/** THE ONE FADE, for every link that REPLACES the signal rather than adding to it.

    An additive link — the delay, the room — needs none of this: stop feeding it and its own tail
    is the fade. A link that replaces has no tail to ride out; drop it out of the path and the
    waveform takes a step, and a step is a click. So it is crossfaded against the signal it was
    handed: dry at one end, what the block made at the other.

    The whole point is that it costs NOTHING while nothing is happening. A fade that is finished
    reports `moving() == false`, and the call site then either runs the block plainly or skips it
    plainly — no copy of the signal, no per-sample multiply. Only the fifteen milliseconds after a
    switch is touched pay for anything, which is why the length can be generous enough to be
    inaudible without anybody having to think about the cost.

    Message thread sets nothing here: the audio thread reads its switches itself and this only
    follows what it read. */
